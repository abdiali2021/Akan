      <div class="color"> <p> Akan names , were the first names usually given to a child immediately after birth.
        The Akans believe that this is the name which a person's soul offers them,since it is the soul of a person which decides when to let
        the unborn child into this world...hence the term 'kradin' which directly translates to "soul names"
        It was a common belief among the Akans that the day of birth of a person would affect behaviour,fate and even the person's future.</p> </div>
